Since this paper is suitable to generate heuristic for {problem}, we start to read.
The previous section you are interested in is: {last_interested_section}.
The content is:
{last_interested_content}

This is all sections in dict format:
{remaining_section_dict}

Please consider whether the read content are enough for you to generate the heuristic for {problem}.
1. If you think you are ready to implement the heuristic, please give me a heuristic name and respond to me ***interested_section:{your_heuristic_name}***, replace {your_heuristic_name} with heuristic name.
2. If you think you need to read more, respond to me ***interested_section:section_name***.
3. If you think we can not generate heuristic from this paper, respond to me ***interested_section:None***.
Please select at most one section each time, and the section name should align with provided dict.
Also to avoid the content is too large, we can start from leaf section.

The response format is very important. For better communication, please respond to me in this format:
***interested_section:section_name/your_heuristic_name/None***
Ensure there is no other content inside the ***, and analysis outside *** is welcome.
If you think no superior operation, simply respond with ***None***.
