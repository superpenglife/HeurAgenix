Try to implement the get_state_data_feature function in python:
def get_state_data_feature(global_data: dict, state_data: dict) -> dict

The input are global_data and state_data.
{global_data_introduction}
{state_data_introduction}

The output is algo a dict, which contains the following features as keys: {state_data_features}.

Please note:
1. Never modify the global_data and state_data
2. The name of function must be get_state_data_feature.
3. No any omissions or placeholders, I'm just going to use the code.
4. Comments in the code are very important.


The response format is very important. For better communication, please respond to me in this format:
***python_code:
import library (if necessary)
def get_state_data_feature(global_data: dict, state_data: dict) -> dict:
    """ Feature to extract the feature of global data.

    Args:
        {global_data_introduction}
        {state_data_introduction}

    Returns:
        The feature of current solution, which can represents the current state with:
            - feature_name (type of value): description
            - feature_name (type of value): description
            ...
    """
