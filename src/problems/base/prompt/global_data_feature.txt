We aim to collaboratively create two distinct functions. The first function will be designed to methodically extract and distill features from global data. The second function will focus on extracting features that encompass both the characteristics and quality of current solutions. These functions will be underpinned by rigorous statistical analysis and domain-specific knowledge, ensuring they are both accurate and relevant.

Let's begin by focusing on the features of the global data for the {problem}. 
{global_data_introduction}

In determining the optimal features (statistical data) to represent global data features, we must adhere to the following criteria:
1. The data representation should be succinct to minimize computational load while retaining sufficient granularity to recognize the feature of the problem and solution.
2. It must incorporate unique attributes that aid in the clear distinction between different instances.

Now, please tell me which features are best serve as global data features.

The response format is very important. For better communication, please respond to me in this format:
***global_data_feature:
feature_name;how_to_calculate;reason
feature_name;how_to_calculate;reason
....
***
Ensure there is no other content inside the ***, and analysis outside *** is welcome.
If you have no information to provide, simply respond with ***None***.
