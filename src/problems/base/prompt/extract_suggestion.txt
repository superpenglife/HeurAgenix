To evaluate the validity of your suggestion, we keep the operations before step {bottleneck_operation_id}, integrate {proposed_operation} in step {bottleneck_operation_id} and applying the {function_name} for remaining steps. Now we got the update result

The updated result: {proposed_solution} with {proposed_result}
{proposed_trajectory}

Compared with origin negative result from {function_name}: {negative_solution} with {negative_result}
{negative_trajectory}

Your propose works well.

Now review the {function_name}:
{function_introduction}.
We hope to extract this into rule to get the suggestion for improvement of {function_name}:
Please note:
1. I believe that in most cases, our rule works in a scope of applicability, that is, it is effective in certain circumstances. Outside of this scope, we still maintain the original algorithm.
2. The rule must be clear and calculate. For example, choosing operation A brings greater benefits in the form of rebates, but we do not know how to measure future benefits.
3. Rule must have nothing todo with current data. It should be general experience.

Combined previous calculate process: 
{calculation_process}
And application scope: 
{application_scope}
By the way, we believe no rule can works for all application scope, sometimes it works and sometimes it may not work. So application scope is important.
Extract this analysis into rule to improve the {function_name}.
consider to raise suggestion:
1. better selection
2. better parameters
3. insert more structure
4. learn from other heuristics

The response format is very important. For better communication, please respond to me in this format:
