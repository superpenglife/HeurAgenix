Now, we have already found the similarities between {referenced_problem} and this new problem {problem}:
{similarities_in_problem}

To support {referenced_problem}, I build the Solution and Operator framework.
The Solution is designed as:
{referenced_problem_solution_class}
Operator servers as a mechanism to modify solution, which enables the application of heuristic algorithms. 
To support heuristic algorithm, we have build the following operators:
{referenced_problem_operation_class}

This is the code for {referenced_heuristic}:
{referenced_heuristic_code}

{referenced_global_data_introduction}
{referenced_state_data_introduction}

Try to make up the similarities between {referenced_heuristic} and this new problem {problem}.
If no more similarities, return me ***similarities:None***

The response format is very important. For better communication, please respond to me in this format:
***similarities:
components_in_{referenced_heuristic};similar_components_in_{problem};reason;
components_in_{referenced_heuristic};similar_components_in_{problem};reason;
...
***
Ensure there is no other content inside the ***, and analysis outside *** is welcome.
If you have no information to provide, simply respond with ***None***.
