Based on previous discuss, we get the heuristic {heuristic_name}:
{description}

Now please implement it in python function {function_name}.

To implement this heuristic function in python, please note:
1. We can assume that Solution and all Operators are imported in "src.problems.{problem}.components".
2. The operator type must be defined previously, do not create a new one in your code.
3. Never modify the data in global, state and algorithm data.
4. All hyper parameters in kwargs should be set a default value.
5. Any reasonable partial solution may be used as input, such as an empty solution.
6. Comments in the code are very important. They must clearly explain which hyper-parameters are required by the algorithm (i.e., the parameters in **kwargs), how the algorithm proceeds, and under what circumstances it will not return any operator or will return an empty operator. We hope that people can understand the principles and workflow of the algorithm clearly just by reading the comments, without needing to look at the code.
7. The name of function must be {function_name}. The TargetOperatorType should be replaced by real returned operator type.
8. No any omissions or placeholders, I'm just going to use the code.
9. For the algorithm to update the algorithm_data, do not modify directly "algorithm_data["abc"] = 123", we should return operator, {"abc": 123}.For algorithm that do not update them, just return operator, {}
10. For the circumstances that algorithm return empty operator, please return None, {}.
11. Make the result must be valid.

For {problem} problem, take about following:

The response format is very important. For better communication, please respond to me in this format:

    """ Description for this heuristic algorithm.

    Args:
        global_data (dict): The global data dict containing the global data. In this algorithm, the following items are necessary:
            - necessary_key (value type): description
            - necessary_key (value type): description
            ...
        state_data (dict): The state dictionary containing the current state information. In this algorithm, the following items are necessary:
            - necessary_key (value type): description
            - necessary_key (value type): description
            ...
        (Optional and can be omitted if no algorithm data) algorithm_data (dict): The algorithm dictionary for current algorithm only. In this algorithm, the following items are necessary:
            - necessary_key (value type): description
            - necessary_key (value type): description

        (Optional and can be omitted if no used) get_state_data_function (callable): The function receives the new solution as input and return the state dictionary for new solution, and it will not modify the origin solution.
        (Optional and can be omitted if no hyper parameters data) introduction for hyper parameters in kwargs if used.

        Description of this operator.
        Description of updated algorithm data.
